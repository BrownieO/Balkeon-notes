# Laconic Balkeon Notes
## Introduction
Balkeon is a fork of Esperanto. It was created by MetroMan, a Chilean translator, amateur artist and worker at Metro. He went for the Babelian approach and borrowed words from many languages of the world (for non-core words at least).
In this website, we will do a brief overview of this conlang. The full breakdown will be available at MetroMan's website.
