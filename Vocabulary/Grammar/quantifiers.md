# Quantifiers
Quantifiers are roots that indicate amount. They are:
- tut = wholly
- part = at least some
- half = exactly 50%

When used as root, their meaning depends on the next word:
- before root: quality
- before "em": quantity
- before gender: concept

Example:
- tut + manon = wholly man
- tut + manideon = wholly masculine
- tut + em + manson = every man
- manon os tuteon = the whole of a man

You can prepend "tan" to get false quantifiers. Nek + half means not exactly half.
