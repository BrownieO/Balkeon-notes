# Quantifiers
Quantifiers are roots that indicate amount. They are:
- tut = wholly<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- part = at least some<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- half = exactly 50%<span class="blind-only">.</span>

Their meaning depends on the next root:
- "em": quantity<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- other roots: quality<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- gender: the concept<span class="blind-only">.</span>

Example:
- tut + manon = wholly man<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- tut + manidu = wholly masculine<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- tut + em + manson = every man<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- manon os tuteon = the whole of a man<span class="blind-only">.</span>

You can prepend "tan" to get negated quantifiers:
- tantut: not at all<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- tanpart: at least some isn't<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- tanhalf: 50% isn't<span class="blind-only">.</span>

Finally, nek + half means not exactly half.
