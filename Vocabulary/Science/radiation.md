# Radiation
Radiation is the remote transmission of energy.

## Electromagnetic radiation (Yahreon)
This is waves that combine both an electric and a magnetic field.
Those are named by their wavelength. E.g.:
- infrared = dakronu
- visible = biradidu
- ultraviolet = onkraimorasku

## Particle radiation (Ipaneon)
This is fast subatomic particles...
