## Electromagnetic radiation (Yahreon)
This consists of waves that combine both an electric and a magnetic field.
Those are named by their wavelength. E.g.:
- infrared = dakroneon<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- visible = biradideon<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- ultraviolet = onkraimoraskeon<span class="blind-only">.</span>
