# Arithmetic
Arithmetic deals with the manipulations of numbers.

Their operations are:
- addition = supr<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- subtraction = maen<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- multiplication = bhak/mult<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- division = nhan/div<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- exponentiation = elfnhan / elfmult<span class="blind-only">.</span>
    - exponent suffix = fos<span class="blind-only">.</span>

To assign maximum precedence to an operator, append "el" to it.
