# Numbers
Numbers are mathematical objects used to count, measure and label.
There are two symbols used to denote them: the Arabic numerals, and words such as the cardinal, ordinal and fractional numerals.
The digits that form them are:

- 0 = Naul<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 1 = Uan<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 2 = Chos<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 3 = Tre<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 4 = Kuar<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 5 = Sink<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 6 = Sis<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 7 = Seti<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 8 = Oich<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 9 = Nuef<span class="blind-only">.</span>

And the powers of ten are:
  
- 10 = Tek<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 100 = Dien<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 1000 = Miri<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- 1000000 = Miliar<span class="blind-only">.</span>

To form numerals with digit words, you have to be VERY CAREFUL and follow those rules:
- Start with the units. Continue to the right.
- Each digit needs a power of ten suffix.
- Each digit is separated by a space.

Example: 2024 = kuar chostek chosmiri

## Suffixes
Suffixes go in the rightmost digit.
- Cardinal numbers have no suffix.
- The ordinal suffix is "yem" or "esim". Adjetivation also works.
- The fractional suffix is "ake". First, write the nominator and denominator separately. Then, append the suffix to the denominator.
