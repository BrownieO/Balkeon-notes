# Set theory
Sets, "upseon", are collections of elements. Their members are named "ambreon".

Sets have the following relationships:
- subset = inhabestir<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- superset = inhabir<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- complement = nekambrupeon<span class="blind-only">.</span>

And the following operations:
- union = oro<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- intersection = ara<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- difference = maen<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- cartesian product = nhan<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- power set = elfnhanupeon<span class="blind-only">.</span>
