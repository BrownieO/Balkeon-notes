# Adpositions
Adpositions show a physical or non-physical relationship between two words. You can place them before, after or appendded to a word.
If the adposition is behind a word, you can end it with an L or "<span translate="no" lang="es">el</span>" if it ends in a consonant.
The most common adpositions are:
- of = <span translate="no" lang="es">os</span>
- in = <span translate="no" lang="es">un</span>
- from = <span translate="no" lang="es">frok</span>
- towards = <span translate="no" lang="es">ta</span>
- with = <span translate="no" lang="es">ke</span>
- without = <span translate="no" lang="es">ne</span>
