# Adpositions
Adpositions show a physical or non-physical relationship between two words. You can place them before, after or appendded to a word.
When laid before a word, you can end the adposition with an L or "el".
The adpositions are:
- from = frok(el).
- towards = ta(l).
- of = os.
- with = ke(l).
- without = ne(l).
