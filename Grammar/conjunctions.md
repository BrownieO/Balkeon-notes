# Conjunctions
Conjunctions are parts of speech that connect words or groups of words.

All conjunctions are on [MetroManâ€™s website](https://www.metroman.me/en/balkeon/docs/conjunctions/).

Boolean connectives have their own [vocabulary page](https://brownieo.github.io/Balkeon-notes/Vocabulary/Math/bool.html).
