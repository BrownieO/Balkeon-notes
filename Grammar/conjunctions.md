# Conjunctions
Conjunctions are parts of speech that connect the words or groups of words around them.

The most used conjunctions are "ara" (and) and "oro" (or).

More conjunctions are available on [MetroManâ€™s website](https://metromansr.github.io/MetroWeb/en/balkeon/docs/conjunctions/) and in the [boolean connective page](https://brownieo.github.io/Balkeon-notes/Vocabulary/Math/bool.html).
