# Cases
Case means showing the role of a word in a sentence.

## Accusative and nominative
Those cases mark the object and the subject of a sentence respectively.
This case doesn't exist in Balkeon. TODO: save for the unexplained "em" in "namnemeon"

## Definite and indefinite words
Words are indefinite by default.
To make a word definite, erase the final N if present. Then, add an L.

## Dative
The dative case indicates the recipient of an action.
To achieve this, append "stan".

## Genitive
The genitive case indicates possession.
To achieve this, append "os".
