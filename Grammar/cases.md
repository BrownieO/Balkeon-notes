# Cases
Case indicates what a word does in a sentence.

## Accusative and nominative
Those cases mark the object and the subject of a sentence respectively.
This case doesn't exist in Balkeon. TODO: save for the unexplained "em" in namnemeon

## Definite and indefinite words
To make a word definite, if there's a final N, erase it. Then, add an L.

## "Dative"
The dative case indicates the recipient of an action.
To achieve this, append "stan".

## Genitive
The genitive case indicates possession.
To achieve this, append "os".
