# Cases
Cases are categories of words based on their role in a sentence. Sometimes, such role is marked with a morhpeme.

## Accusative and nominative
Those cases indicate the object and the subject of a sentence respectively. They aren't marked in Balkeon.

## Dative
The dative case indicates the recipient of an action. Its marker is the suffix "stan".

## Genitive
The genitive case indicates possession. Its marker is the suffix "os".

## Definite and indefinite words
Words are indefinite by default.
To make a word definite, erase the final N if present. Then, add an L.
