# Roots
Roots represent ontological entities. You can combine and suffix them to create words.

## Root stacking
Roots are stacked like in germanic languages. E.g.
- underground train = ah + chuch + train + eon<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- Balkeon learning = Balkeon + lern + ian<span class="blind-only">.</span>

## Suffixation
Roots can be static or dynamic, like "dog" or "love". However, by adding a suffix, you can convert every root into a noun, verb or both.
