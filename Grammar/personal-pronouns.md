# Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns can replace any noun.

Any gender root denotes a third person pronoun. An "ay" suffix switches it to first person, while an S at the leftmost position indicates plurality.

The genders are:
- e = general<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- yo = man<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- ya = woman<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- yao = man and woman<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- eo = male animal/inanimate<span class="blind-only">.</span>
- ea = female animal<span class="blind-only">.</span>

and the only second person pronoun is "yu" (you).
