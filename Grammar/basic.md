# Basic word formation
## Roots
Roots can be static or dynamic, like "dog" or "love". However, by adding a suffix, you can convert every root into a noun, verb or both.

The vocabulary section is(n't) [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). TODO

## Nouns
To make a noun, append a gender suffix. E.g.:
- kan + eon = dog
- kan + aon = female dog
- am + eon = love
- am + on = male lover
    - Note: human genders imply a human.

## Verbs
To make a verb, append a tense. E.g.:
- am + ian = to love
- am + ir = loves
- kan + ian = to dog
- kan + ir = dogs

## Both noun and verb
To make both a noun and verb, append a tense and a gender. E.g.: TODO: linguistic term
- am + ir + eon = the loving
- am + dog + eon = the dogging
- am + ir + aon = person who is loving

## Plurals
To indicate many, add an S behind the gender suffix. E.g.:
- kanseon = dogs
- amseon = loves

There are alternatives to the S. Those are:
- R: for roots ending in B, C, D, G, P, S, X, Y, Z
- us: for affricates and consonant clusters containing R, L, S

## Adjectives
To convert a noun into an adjective, insert the particle "id". E.g.:
- kanideon = canine
- amideon = loving

## Root stacking
Roots are stacked like in germanic languages. E.g.:
- underground train = ahchuch + train + eon
- Balkeon learning = Balkeon + lern + ian
