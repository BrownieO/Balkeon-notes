# Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns can replace any noun.

Any gender root denotes a third person pronoun. An "ay" suffix switches it to first person, while an S at the leftmost position indicates plurality.

The genders are:
- e = general
- yo = man
- ya = woman
- yao = man and woman
- eo = male animal/inanimate
- ea = female animal

and the only second person pronoun is "yu" (you).
