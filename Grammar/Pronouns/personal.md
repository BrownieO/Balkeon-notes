# Personal pronouns
Personal pronouns can replace any noun.

In Balkeon, all gender roots denote a pronoun in third person. To make it first person, prepend "ay". To indicate plurality, attach an S at the leftmost position.

The only pronouns in second person are "yu" (you), and "syu" (you all).

The genders are:
- e = general
- o = man
- a = woman
- ao = man and woman
- eo = male animal/inanimate
- ea = female animal
